# Hi, I'm Amarjeet 👋 

Hey! I'm Amarjeet. I just finished my Computer Engineering degree and I'm excited to jump into backend development. Coding's my thing, you know? I love the idea of building stuff that actually helps people out.

Technology moves fast, doesn't it? But that's what makes it fun. I'm always trying to learn new things to keep up. It's pretty cool to think about how we can use all this technology to make the world a bit better.

I'm just starting out, but I'm ready to tackle whatever comes my way. Every challenge is a chance to get better at what I do. So yeah, that's me - new grad, code enthusiast, always learning, and excited to see where this dev journey takes me!
